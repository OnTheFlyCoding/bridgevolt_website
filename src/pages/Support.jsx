                            <h2>Warranty Period</h2>
                            <p>All our kits come with a 1 year warranty from the date of delivery or installation at an in person event. Activation of the warranty is subject to all customers completing a post-installation form if installed by the customer. This is done by by submitting photos  of your installed kit per the instructions provided in your kit or in the instruction section of this website. We will review the submission to ensure the kit is installed correctly. This checkup can be completed at any time, but the warranty will not be activated until it is approved.</p>

                            <h2>Warranty Coverage</h2>
                            <p>We cover the workmanship for all the components provided in the e-bike kit and installation issues but only if installed by a Bridgevolt associate at one of our in person events. If the e-bike kit is installed by the customer, photos or videos be submitted per the included instructions to Bridgevolt so our team can verify correct installation before accepting warranty claims.</p>
                            <p>Warranty does not cover customer induced damage of components, such as mishandling or excessive water exposure. That said, Bridgevolt Cooperative will make every effort to ensure that your e-bike is able to continue operating even in the event of customer induced damage and will work with you to ensure that any costs and downtime for repair or replacement of components are as low as is feasible.</p>
                            <p>To initiate a warranty claim, please contact us at bridgevolt@gmail.com Please reference your serial number (on the battery) in all communications to do with Warranty claims.</p>
